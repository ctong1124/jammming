Thanks for code reviewing my project. In the Spotify.js file where my code interacts with the Spotify API, I have a strange bug when receiving the accessToken from the API. I have to click search once to get the the response in the form of of URL, and then click search a second time to actually parse the url into values. After the initial two-click it works fine because the file has a global value of accessToken. I was unable to find a solution with other coursemates and the tutor through the live chat. Please let me know if you know of a way to fix this bug.
